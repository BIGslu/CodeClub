Challenge   | Following TidyTuesday (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/2021), or tackling an open BIGslu GitHub issue, we work as a team to tackle coding challenges in R. Great for beginners! 
Code review | Aimed at improving code and solving problems, these sessions provide formal review of member-submitted code. For details, see https://github.com/BIGslu/CodeReview
Discussion  | These sessions provide informal discussion of current methods in bioinformatics. Members can submit topics such as R packages, journal articles, recent seminars, etc. Please review any posted literature _**prior**_ to the session.
i4TB        | Seminars and workshops in partnership with i4TB, https://trtc.uw.edu/education/i4tb-working-group
Workshop    | Come ready to code-along or just watch these live-coded workshops! For details, see https://github.com/BIGslu/workshops
