Hands-on workshop | Come ready to code-along or just watch these live-coded workshops! Specific instructions will be posted for each topic.
Method discussion | These sessions provide informal discussion of current methods in bioinformatics. Members can submit topics such as R packages, journal articles, new software, etc. Please review any posted literature _**prior**_ to the session.
Mini-hackathon    | In small groups, participants tackle current GitHub issues on BIGslu packages and code.
